Using API with PHP

Include 'QRCodeAPI.class.php' in your project and initialize a new 'QRCodeAPI' instance.

include_once("include/QRCodeAPI.class.php");
$api = new QRCodeAPI();
$png = $api->generate("http://www.good-survey.com", "png");
$png = $api->encode("http://www.good-survey.com", "png", 5, 8, 4, "byte", "M");
$json = $api->decode("images/http-www-good-survey-com.png");

See comments in the sample.

Thanks to Bill Ortell for CURL code and testing.
